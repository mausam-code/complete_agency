## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Template Syntax Errors
**Issue**: `TemplateSyntaxError: Could not parse the remainder`
**Solution**: Complex Django ORM queries in templates have been simplified using context processors

#### 2. Missing Templates
**Issue**: `TemplateDoesNotExist`
**Solution**: All required templates have been created with placeholder content

#### 3. Permission Denied
**Issue**: Users can't access certain pages
**Solution**: Check user role and level - permissions are hierarchical

#### 4. Database Issues
**Issue**: Database errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py setup_sample_data
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Check for issues
python3 manage.py check

# Create migrations
python3 manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
python3 manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

# Setup sample data
python3 manage.py setup_sample_data

# Collect static files (for production)
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```
